Focus on knowledge management (more than just note taking) and setting
up first Linux virtual machine.

Zettelkasten Method Adapted from Niklas Luhmann

-   “Slip” “Boxes”
-   “Second brain” for messy knowledge capture and review
-   Not the same as a blog, but blogs and books come from
-   “Personal Knowledge Graph” is popular name today
-   Beware of non-standard proprietary lockin

Zettel Limits Help You

-   Title less than 50 UNICODE characters
-   Body of about 25-30 lines
-   References including URLs section after body
-   Hashtags on last line after 4-space indent
-   Use an Isosec identifier because human friendly
-   Stick with single level lists
-   Avoid subheadings (which are more for posts)

Install VirtualBox

-   VirtualBox is free
-   Use VMWare Fusion if you have Mac M1

Install Ubuntu Server Interactively

-   Download from Canonical web site
-   Make sure “server” since smaller
-   Server version emulates a cloud on our machine
-   Find “New” from menus or icons
-   Pick Linux from OS pull-down
-   Pick Ubuntu 64-bit from pull-down
-   Set about 2048 MB RAM
-   Set about 20GB disk

Boot Ubuntu Server and Look Around

  💥 You might have to enable “hypervisor” in your BIOS. Every BIOS and
  computer is different. If you need help, consult our Discord helpers
  or ask in Twitch/IRC chat.

Now we have to actually go through the boot process and do the Server
configuration. Almost all of the defaults are correct. The only
difference is that we will enable the SSH server.

-   Navigate around a bit to ensure working
-   Practice starting, stopping, an saving VM
-   ls -la
-   man ls
-   pwd
-   shutdown -h now, init 0, poweroff
