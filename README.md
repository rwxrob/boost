## What's a "Beginner Boost"?

The SKILSTAK Beginner Boost™ is an annual free, live, recorded, tech
series focused on helping people get security and IT operations jobs. We
start Wednesday May the 4th at 11:11:11 and have weekly live four-hour
sessions on Sundays (posted to YouTube 24 hours after recorded due to
Twitch policy). See https://twitch.tv/rwxrob/schedule for schedule
changes, etc.

### The Bike Analogy

You're learning to ride a bike, a beautiful banana seat Schwinn perhaps.
You love that bike, so sexy and sleek, but you just can't get on it
without falling on your face. So you get help from someone who knows how
to ride, they show you, let you try, spot you while you figure out
balance, and, finally, they give you a big push to give you momentum.
That boost let's you feel how everything works together. You get it.
You're riding. You have a lot left to learn (wheelies will have to wait)
but you are riding. That's what the SKILSTAK Beginner Boost is all about.

I've boosted hundreds at this point. They are doing crazy amazing
things, perhaps I'll tell you some of their stories someday, but first,
let's focus on *your* story. Every boost for every person is totally
different, because every person is different. That is why one-on-one
mentored learning is the one true human pedagogy, the best way humans
have been learning since before we had a word for it. But, somehow we've
forgotten this. Our "educational" systems are focused on everything
*but* individual, customized learning from mentors who know (but
God-damn they have a great football team). You probably already sense
this. You don't have to accept it. Be a part of the rebellion, take back
your learning, empower yourself, and then learn to empower others. It's
perhaps the most important social contract every human has with the
members of their society around them. Hording knowledge is the dark
side.

After writing that last paragraph, you might be asking, well how does
one-on-one mentoring happen on Twitch? 

The answer is simple: it doesn't.

Unfortunately, Twitch is the best I can do (at the moment). I taught
one-on-one for more than three years, but the American socio-economic
system forced me give it up, literally. If I had the funding, I'd grow
SKILSTAK back into a multinational company focused on connecting working
professionals with those needing to learn (masters with
disciples/padawan) without regard for political boundaries and ideology.
But so far, no one wants to fund such an effort.

So here I am, using the next best thing I can find. Hopefully, it will
feel like I'm working with each of you individually, and *you* have a
responsibility to help the person next to you ("I bulls-eyed Womprats in
my T16 and they aren't much bigger than two meters.") Let me be clear:
you are *not* competing with other learners. Get that scarcity mentality
out of your head. There's more than enough opportunity for *everyone*.
Fear of scarcity leads to the dark side. It's like establishing trade
routes in Civ (the game). Trade lifts *everyone*. Sharing lifts
*everyone*. It's an objective truth.

🌟 ***The Boost is not a course.*** I need to make sure everyone
understands this above all. There's no syllabus, no certificate, no
credential, no proof you did anything except your own work and
knowledge. There's barely a schedule and we change that organically as
we go through it. Most people need to get the old, broken ideas about
learning out of their heads --- and start learning and thinking like a
"hacker."

## What specific skills will I learn?

The Boost focuses on upskilling a basic computer user into a entry-level
engineer proficient with the Linux terminal, bash scripting, basic Go
programming, and just enough Git and Web development to create and
maintain a basic portfolio web site. The rest is up to you.

Here's a list of our main goals (which roughly correspond to week
number):

1.  Demonstrate autodidactic learning habits
2.  Share learning, discoveries, and theories
3.  Install and maintain a local Ubuntu Server VM
4.  Setup Secure Shell and GPG for safe remote access
5.  Navigate and manage filesystem with bash commands
7.  Manage Linux processes from command line
8.  Install and use TMUX from Linux command line
9.  Install and use Vim from Linux command line
10. Write safe shell scripts in POSIX and bash
6.  Follow the UNIX philosophy and know why
11. Search the Web from the Linux command line
12. Use Docker to use and create container images
13. Create and use a Go Bonzai composite command tree
14. Describe how Internet works (DNS, TCP, and HTTP)
15. Create and maintain a minimal REST API with Go
16. Create and maintain a minimal IRC/Twitch bot in Go
17. Create and maintain a Web site
18. Use Git and GitHub to create and maintain source
19. Build personal/professional learning network
20. Find gainful employment as a technologist

## When are they?

Sessions take place every Saturday 1-5pm (New York time) with "office
hours" Sundays 1-3pm. Sometimes they will be moved or cancelled
depending on personal conflicts and holidays. Sometimes I'll do "office
hours" outside on a walk, or while longboarding. Sometimes we'll go
slightly longer depending on the content. Check the
<https://twitch.tv/rwxrob/schedule> for when.

## Five hours? Do you take breaks?

* 12 minutes off
* 54 minutes on

Yes, we pretty strictly take a 12 minute break ever 54 minutes. This
let's everything sink it, let's people ask questions of one another, and
allows for biological needs (eating, stretching, bathroom, etc.)

This timing also happens to be the exact times required by Twitch to
ensure we are not interrupted with ad breaks by taking them
intentionally instead.

## What can I do to get ready?

Please make sure you have a computer with at least the following minimum
specs:

* Windows 10 or Mac x86
* 4 Core (x86)
* 8 GB Memory (RAM)
* 100 GB Free HD

Also make sure you meet the SKILSTAK minimum
[requirements](requirements) — especially installing VirtualBox onto a
computer on which you have admin permissions. We are hear to help if you
have questions about any of these requirements. Check the [FAQ](faq) for
answers to your questions or ask them in the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/9wydZXY) server or live during Sunday [AMA
sessions](https://twitch.tv/rwxrob/schedule). Videos of sessions are
always saved to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/rwxrob) and posted to
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwxrob).

## What changed since 2021?

These changes are designed to empowering people with skills they need to
*take themselves* to the next level, to pedal on their own (so to speak)
after getting a good boost, both in ability and motivation.

* More pair programming
* Longer, about 18 weeks
* 5-hours on Saturday (not daily)
* Prep specifically for cloud native and security jobs (only)
* Single, unedited YouTube video (no chapters unless you add)
* Heavy on Go [Bonzai](https://github.com/rwxrob/bonzai) programming
* Headless Linux Ubuntu server VM on local machine (Mac, Windows, Linux)
* Lighter on containers (Docker) and no Kubernetes

## Will you be doing Boosts for anything else?

I'm toying with the idea of having Boosts year round. I'm conflicted
because we can focus on the main one and create better material --- even
a book --- or we can cover more stuff.

If I do add more boosts here's the schedule I am considering. I can't
promise anything on this. The 18 Weeks of the main Beginner Boost is a
huge commitment to prepare for it *every year* since it is constantly
changing.

* 18 Weeks (Sep/3-Dec/31): Infrastructure Engineering (II)
* 10 Weeks (Jan/7-Apr/22): Containers and Kubernetes (III)
