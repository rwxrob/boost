The reason for “no derivatives” CC requirement is to preserve the
consistency of opinions throughout the content since attribution is
required. Without it, forks with changed opinions and resource listings
could be purposefully or accidentally taken as the opinions of the
original author. This is simply too dangerous to allow. The “no
derivatives” clause protects against the inevitable “consensus” problem
that plagues community-created content. That said, please reach out by
email if you have questions about contributing and collaborating.
