# The Beginner Boost™ by Rob Muhlestein

Hello friend. Welcome to the Beginner Boost! This is one way I want to
give back to the stream community that has given me so much. I try to
kick a Boost off every year on May the 4th and have tried to do "days"
in the past. Going forward (probably starting in 2022) we'll remove the
notion of days and have a path/map that you can follow at your own pace.
Then the AMA sessions every week will be focused on helping people get
through the content on their own as best they can.

* Peek at upcoming 2022 [Boost][2022] (in development)
* Start the 2021 [Boost][2021] (but ends abruptly)
* Watch videos from 2020 (first) [Boost][2020] (older)

The reason for “no derivatives” CC requirement is to preserve the
consistency of opinions throughout the content since attribution is
required. Without it, forks with changed opinions and resource listings
could be purposefully or accidentally taken as the opinions of the

derivatives” clause protects against the inevitable “consensus” problem
that plagues community-created content. That said, please reach out by
