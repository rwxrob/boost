# âš¡ SKILSTAK 2023 Terminal Velocity Boostâ„¢

The SKILSTAK Terminal Velocity Beginner Boostâ„¢ is an annual free, live,
recorded, tech series focused on helping people get fast and proficient
with Bash terminal Mac, Windows, Linux, or UNIX. The video series is
meant to accompany the book that goes with it (also free):

**[Terminal Velocity: Mastering the Fastest Human-Computer
Interface](https://github.com/rwxrob/book-terminal-velocity)**

Careers in IT infrastructure engineering, security, software
development, machine learning, data science, academia and cloud-native
computing all depend heavily on good terminal skills.

## "What does it start?"

We start Wednesday May the 4th at 11:11:11 and have weekly live
four-hour sessions on Saturdays (posted to YouTube the next day due to
Twitch policy). Make sure to join Discord and consider adding the
calendar (both linked from [Twitch](http://rwxrob.tv)).

## "So is this a course?"

ðŸŒŸ ***The Boost is not a course.*** There's no syllabus, no certificate,
no credential, no proof you did anything except your own work and
knowledge. There's barely a schedule and we change that organically as
we go through it. Most people need to get the old, broken ideas about
learning out of their heads --- and start learning and thinking like a
"hacker."

## "What specific skills will I learn?"

The boost focuses on upskilling a basic computer user into a entry-level
terminal power user and all that requires. Here's a high-level outline
of the skills and topics covered:

1.  Setup a terminal with bash in it
2.  Navigate and manage files from command line
3.  Manage processes from command line
4.  Edit text with nano, ed, vi, vim, neovim, and emacs
5.  Save source to GitHub with gh from command line
6.  Write safe shell scripts in bash and ash with shellcheck
7.  Follow UNIX philosophies and use filters over plugins
8.  Customize Bash profile and environment
9.  Customize Vim text editing sessions
10. Manage terminal windows with screen and TMUX
11. Do effective research from command line with lynx and w3m
12. Create simple command-line tools in Python and Go
13. Organize your scripts and tools for portability

## "When are Boost sessions?"

The [calendar](https://bit.ly/rwxrobsched) has the times, which
sometimes change and can be cancelled due to other conflicts. Use `!cal`
to get this link anytime from the Twitch chat.

## "Four hours? Do you take breaks?"

Yes. When they make sense. If you need longer breaks then re-watch the
videos and pause them, or just follow the book intsead.

## "What can I do to get ready?"

Please make sure you have a computer with at least the following minimum
specs:

* Windows 10 or Mac x86 (Linux is fine if you know how already)
* 4 Core (x86)
* 8 GB Memory (RAM)
* 100 GB Free HD

Also make sure you meet the SKILSTAK minimum
