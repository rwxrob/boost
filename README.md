# âš¡ 2023 SKILSTAK Beginner Boost

The SKILSTAK Beginner Boostâ„¢ is designed to give you a ðŸš€ boost toward getting a tech career (or a power up if you already have one). For over a decade the Boost has been helping people at SKILSTAK gain a significant advantage over others entering tech careers. Unfortunately, most of the stuff in the Boost *still* isn't covered anywhere else.

Since 2020 SKILSTAK has moved from a physical location to a Twitch/YouTube/Discord community. The Boost itself is an annual free, weekly, recorded, casual, live mentored, video series that introduces UNIX and Linux terminal skills essential for fast growing, high-paying tech careers such as the following:

* Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)
* Cloud Native Engineer
* Machine Learning Engineer
* Systems Engineer
* Infrastructure Engineer
* DevOps Engineer
* Security Analyst
* Software Developer
* Computer Scientist
* Computer Engineer
* Robotics Engineer
* Rocket Scientist
* Physicist
* Astronomer
* Any other career involving science and technology

## "When does it start?"

We start Wednesday May the 4th at 11:11:11 and have weekly live
three-hour sessions on Saturdays (posted to YouTube the next day due to
Twitch policy). Make sure to join Discord and consider adding the
calendar (both linked from [Twitch](http://rwxrob.tv)).

## "So is this a course?"

ðŸŒŸ ***The Boost is not a course.*** There's no syllabus, no certificate,
no credential, no proof you did anything except your own work and
knowledge. There's barely a schedule and we change that organically as
we go through it. Most people need to get the old, broken ideas about
learning out of their heads --- and start learning and thinking like a
"hacker."

## "What specific skills will I learn?"

The boost focuses on upskilling a basic computer user into a entry-level
terminal power user and all that requires. Here's a high-level outline
of the skills and topics covered:

1.  Setup a terminal with bash in it.
2.  Navigate and manage files from command line.
3.  Manage processes from command line.
4.  Edit text with nano, ed, vi, vim.
5.  Take efficient notes in Markdown.
6.  Work with structured data in JSON, YAML, and delimited formats.
7.  Save source to GitHub with gh from command line.
8.  Write safe shell scripts in bash and ash with shellcheck.
9.  Follow UNIX philosophies and use filters over plugins.
10. Customize Bash profile and environment.
11. Customize Vim text editing sessions.
12. Manage terminal windows with screen and TMUX.
13. Do effective research from command line with lynx and w3m.
14. Code a little in Bash, Python, C, and Go.
15. Organize commands for portability.
16. Create and maintain a consumable, sustainable resume.
17. Learn just enough Web development to create a personal profile page.
18. Network and foster a professional learning network.
19. Know when and how to certify.
20. Get a good starting tech job.

!!! note

    Many of the above will take more than one week to cover.

## "When are Boost sessions?"
