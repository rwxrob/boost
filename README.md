# Beginner Boost

![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-red.svg)

Every [May the 4th] I hold a free series of live-recorded *Beginner
Boost* sessions on [Twitch] and [YouTube] that run through the end of July
(or so). Below is the outline of current and planned content. This is a
living document; it changes from day to day --- even hour to hour ---
[like software].

> 🌟 You may want to *Watch* this GitHub repo to be notified of updates and
changes. A *Star* would be nice as well. If you want to contribute open
an *Issue* to discuss it. Much of the content will be drawn from my
[personal Zettelkasten repo] and my [learning labs] (which you might
also want to watch for changes, but they are not always Boost related).
You can also help fund this project by clicking *Sponsor*. Thanks.

## How Long Will It Take?

The Boost is about 128 days of about an hour of video for each plus 2
hours of optional AMA on Fridays. For each hour of video, most will need
to spend at least an hour (usually more) working and experimenting on
their own to learn the material. That's 256 hours *minimum* without AMA,
320 with it.

There are only four days of Boost per week, Monday through Thursday with
Fridays being two hours of AMA. That's 32 weeks, about 8 months, more
than half a year, just for the Boost content, and this is just the
*beginner* stuff.

Consider that things like the freeCodeCamp Web "certification" require
2400+ hours of time on projects and such *just for web development*.
(And I just cannot endorse any part of freeCodeCamp having witnessed it
fail for dozens in a way that gave them a false sense of having learned
it only to be shot down by reality.)

Malcolm Gladwell has suggested it takes 10,000 hours or doing something
to truly master it. Many have objectively shot down this conclusion, but
it certainly will take more than 300 hours.

In other words, this stuff takes time. There is no shortcut. Anyone
saying differently is lying to you (probably to get your money). If you
want to speed things up increase the number of hours you invest in
learning per week, by adding 10 hours on the weekend you can cut the
time for the Boost in half. It all depends on you.

## You Get *Way* More Than You Pay For

If you wondering what this training is worth, I've taken hundreds
through it at the rate of \$50/hour (about \$6400 although I had many
technical professionals tell me I could easily have charged \$100/hour
since it was one-on-one) with many getting in to colleges, elite science
boarding schools, and junior engineering jobs starting with \$100k
salaries. In every case these people put in the time --- a lot of time
--- almost entirely on their own --- to achieve these goals. You can do it
too, but you have to want it. 

This content is all yours for free now and always will be free (except
the ads). Please don't take it for granted just because it is free. Ask
someone who knows. This kind of content isn't out there anyplace else.
In fact, it's become obvious that this content is influencing other
streamers and YouTubers usually without them acknowledging it, which is
fine so long as the learning is getting done. 

Some flashy, shallow content creators have even criticized free sources
of learning like mine saying, "You get what you pay for" putting down
free learning, while pushing their own overpriced "curriculum", and
their corporate sponsors plastered all over their neon walls and tee
shirts. These unfortunate individuals just haven't learned how the
[sharing economy] works (probably because they are so busy working on
their social media marketing instead of learning and adding *real*
value). You know better. I work full-time so that I don't have to charge
you for a paywall in American dollars, plus it keeps me current so I can
pass on what's *actually* happening at work onto you.

If you want to help, above all, spread the word, learn this stuff and
then do something the world *really* needs with your new skills and
knowledge. Pay it forward. 

If you insist on helping me financially, consider sponsoring me for as
little as [\$2/month on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/rwxrob)
where you will get a cool badge that shows you are sponsoring free and
open source content.
