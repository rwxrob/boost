# âš¡ SKILSTAK 2023 UNIX Beginner Boostâ„¢

The SKILSTAK UNIX Beginner Boostâ„¢ is an annual free, live, recorded,
tech series focused on helping people get started with the world's most
powerful operating system: UNIX (and it's popular derivative, Linux, a
"UNIX-like" operating system). Careers in IT infrastructure engineering,
security, software development, machine learning, data science, academia
and cloud-native computing all depend heavily on core UNIX skills.

We start Wednesday May the 4th at 11:11:11 and have weekly live
four-hour sessions on Saturdays (posted to YouTube the next day due to
Twitch policy). Make sure to join Discord and consider adding the
calendar (both linked from [Twitch](http://rwxrob.tv)).

ðŸŒŸ ***The Boost is not a course.*** There's no syllabus, no certificate,
no credential, no proof you did anything except your own work and
knowledge. There's barely a schedule and we change that organically as
we go through it. Most people need to get the old, broken ideas about
learning out of their heads --- and start learning and thinking like a
"hacker."

## "What specific skills will I learn?"

The Boost focuses on upskilling a basic computer user into a entry-level
UNIX/Linux power user and all that requires. Here's a high-level outline
of the skills and topics covered:

1.  Follow the RWX and UNIX philosophies and know why (1)
2.  Setup UNIX/Linux and access with secure shell and GPG (4)
3.  Edit text with nano, ed, vi, vim, neovim, and emacs (2)
4.  Save source to GitHub with gh from command line (1)
5.  Manage terminal windows with screen and TMUX (1)
6.  Navigate and manage files from command line (1)
7.  Manage processes from command line (1)
8.  Write safe shell scripts in bash and ash with shellcheck (4)
9.  Understand how the Internet works (basic networking) (1)
10. Do effective research from command line with lynx and w3m (1)
11. Manage source files with git (2)
12. Identify UNIX/Linux career opportunities (1)

(approximately 20 weeks of 4 hour interactive sessions)

## "When are Boost sessions?"

The [calendar](https://bit.ly/rwxrobsched) has the times, which
sometimes change and can be cancelled due to other conflicts. Use `!cal`
to get this link anytime from the Twitch chat.

## "Four hours? Do you take breaks?"

Yes. When they make sense. If you need longer breaks then re-watch the
videos and pause them.

## "What can I do to get ready?"

Please make sure you have a computer with at least the following minimum
specs:

* Windows 10 or Mac x86 (Linux is fine if you know how already)
* 4 Core (x86)
* 8 GB Memory (RAM)
* 100 GB Free HD

Also make sure you meet the SKILSTAK minimum
[requirements](requirements) â€” especially installing VMWare onto a
computer on which you have admin permissions. We are here to help if you
have questions about any of these requirements.

Check [Discord](https://discord.gg/9wydZXY) and the
[calendar](https://bit.ly/rwxrobsched) for questions sessions. Videos of
sessions are always saved to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/rwxrob) and
posted to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwxrob).
