## Legal Copyright Considerations and Licensing

“Beginner Boost” and “Boost” are legal trademarks of Robert S.
Muhlestein but can be used freely to refer to the this project without
limitation. To avoid potential developer confusion, intentionally using
these trademarks to refer to other projects — free or proprietary — is
prohibited.

Anything you say or do while participating in any part of SKILSTAK
activities, on the <https://twitch.tv/rwxrob> stream, chat, or in
Discord, in text or voice, in public or in private, becomes the legal
intellectual property of Robert S. Muhlestein. (See the opening
paragraph of this page for more.) When in doubt, don't say it or write
it. This is to protect everyone when using comments, quotes (without any
requirement for attribution) and content from the community so that it
may be used free and open (but copyrighted) material such as videos,
clips, podcasts, lessons, books, or in any other way. 

All rights are reserved including the right to publish any communication
from any participant for a price as well (usually to cover the cost of
printing and distribution).

The reason for “no derivatives” LICENSE requirement is to preserve the
consistency of voice and opinions throughout the content since
attribution is required. Without it, forks with changed opinions and
resource listings could be purposefully or accidentally taken as the
opinions of the original author. This is simply too dangerous to allow.
The “no derivatives” clause protects against the inevitable “consensus”
problem that plagues community-created content. That said, please reach
out by email if you have questions about contributing and collaborating.
