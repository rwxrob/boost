# âš¡ SKILSTAK Beginner Boost 2022 - Week 11

## Review Challenge

* Create a *new* script from scratch
* Have the script print "Hello, there."
* Put the logic into a function and call the function
* Run the script from the command line
* Make sure your script is clean and safe
* Extra: make the function use "there" by default if not argument

## Covered

* Difference between concise and verbose scripting
* `[[ ]]` (and why not `[ ]`)
* `help test`
* globstar expansion
* `bc`
* `(( ))`
* `RANDOM%6`
* `=` means "assign right into left"
* `==` means "right is exactly equal to left"
* `&&` logical AND
* `||` local OR
* `!` local NOT (`not`)
* order of operations (*always* use parens)
* `"$@"` pass arguments as separate words
* `"$*"` pass arguments squished together as single word
* short-circuit logic
* `set -exo pipefail`

## For Next Week

* compound data types
* loops, repeats, recursion
* read and IFS
* more special variables
