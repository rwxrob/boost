All about users, files (organization and permissions) from a user,
admin, and hacker perspective including “inodes” and “elevating
privileges”. This is a big topic, so we meander about but cover the main
stuff needed to get you started (more than any other Boost we’ve done so
far). We didn’t get to linking or glob expansion. We’ll start with that
next time and introduce grep, find, and regular expressions.
