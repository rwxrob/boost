# `greet`

Create a command that greets the user in their language as detected from
the environment.

## Requirements

* Create an importable module named `greet` with a `greet` command
* If command arguments passed assume they are name
* Combine all arguments into single argument
* Write a separate function to read one line of standard input
* If no arguments passed, greet generically, and prompt for name
* Detect the language from the host system
* Switch to language detected and print simple greeting in that language
* Write code that could easily have additional languages added

Bonus:

* Add some interesting colors in the text output.

## Concepts

* Command line parameters
* Compound variables
* Maps
