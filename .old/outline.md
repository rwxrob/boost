# SKILSTAK 2022 Beginner Boost Series

This is a very rough outline of what we'll try to cover each week. It's
a guide. You'll notice it starts out with more structure and slowly gets
looser. Boost learning is collaborative, free-form, organic,
exploratory, and messy. It drives traditional "teachers" to mad rage (
which gives me great pleasure). This messy, organic approach is
purposeful, by design. It promotes autodidactic habits. It models
*exactly* how your brain works and how you would be doing the learning
if you were alone, like a hacker trying to learn a creative way to
achieve a specific goal. You probably don't have ADHD, that's just how
human brains work. Ever seen a neural network? They are Anything but
organized. Be one with nature, learn to learn like nature learns. You'll
understand ML even better later.
