# âš¡ SKILSTAK Beginner Boost 2022 - Week 14

Vim configuration overview. Just an exhaustive review of my personal
`.vimrc` file including:

* Why `nvi` is worth learning
* How `neovim` is actually not `vi` at all
* Preferences for fewer plugins
* Use of `Plug` instead of other plugins
* Why 8.* is plenty good for your `.vimrc`
